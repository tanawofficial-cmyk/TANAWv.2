# 🧹 TANAW Cache Cleared - Ready for Fresh Testing

## 📅 Date: October 24, 2025, 8:23 PM

## ✅ What Was Done

All TANAW caching database files have been **backed up and cleared** to test the new improved OpenAI prompt from scratch.

---

## 📦 Cache Files Backed Up

**Location:** `backend/analytics_service/cache_backup_20251024_202354/`

**Files Backed Up:**
1. ✅ `gpt_mapping_cache.db` (12 KB)
2. ✅ `tanaw_cache.db` (49 KB)
3. ✅ `tanaw_column_knowledge.db` (36 KB)
4. ✅ `tanaw_knowledge_base.db` (36 KB)
5. ✅ `tanaw_mapping_cache.db` (24 KB) - from analytics_service
6. ✅ `tanaw_mapping_cache.db` (16 KB) - from root directory

**Total:** 6 cache files safely backed up

---

## 🎯 Current State

**Cache Status:** 🟢 **COMPLETELY CLEAR**

- ✅ No cache files in `backend/analytics_service/`
- ✅ No cache files in root directory
- ✅ All previous mappings cleared
- ✅ OpenAI will process every column from scratch

---

## 🧪 Ready to Test!

Now when you upload a dataset:

1. **Every column will be sent to OpenAI** (no cache hits)
2. **New improved prompt will be used** (conversational, context-rich)
3. **Fresh mappings will be generated** with detailed reasoning
4. **New cache will be created** for future uploads

### **Test Files Ready:**
- `TEST FILES/ambiguous_test_challenge.csv` ⭐⭐⭐
- `TEST FILES/extreme_ambiguity_test.csv` ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- `TEST FILES/mixed_domain_confusion.csv` ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- `TEST FILES/ultimate_ambiguity_challenge.csv` ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

---

## 🔄 To Restore Old Cache (if needed)

If you want to go back to the old cached mappings:

```powershell
# Restore all cache files
Copy-Item -Path "backend/analytics_service/cache_backup_20251024_202354/*" -Destination "backend/analytics_service/" -Force
Move-Item -Path "backend/analytics_service/cache_backup_20251024_202354/tanaw_mapping_cache.db" -Destination "." -Force
```

---

## 📊 What to Observe

### **During Testing:**

1. **Watch Console Logs** - You'll see OpenAI API calls for every column
2. **Check Reasoning** - Look for business context in mapping explanations
3. **Monitor Accuracy** - Are duplicates properly ignored?
4. **Track Cost** - Each column will cost ~$0.00015 (no cache)
5. **Measure Time** - First upload will be slower (no cache hits)

### **After First Upload:**

- New cache will be created automatically
- Second upload of same file will use cache (faster, free)
- Compare mappings with old backup if needed

---

## 💰 Cost Impact (Testing Phase)

**With Cache Cleared:**
- First upload of 20 columns = $0.003 (0.3 cents)
- Each unique column analyzed fresh
- New improved prompt costs ~3x more but worth it!

**After Cache Builds:**
- Subsequent uploads = mostly cached (almost free)
- Only new/unseen columns will call OpenAI

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

### **Old Prompt (cached):**
- Generic reasoning
- Duplicate mappings possible
- 60-70% accuracy on ambiguous files

### **New Prompt (fresh):**
- Business-focused reasoning
- Better duplicate handling
- 85-95% accuracy expected
- Mentions chart requirements
- Clearer confidence scores

## 📝 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload `ambiguous_test_challenge.csv`
- [ ] Check column mappings - only ONE per type?
- [ ] Read reasoning - mentions charts/business context?
- [ ] Verify charts use correct columns
- [ ] Test with `ultimate_ambiguity_challenge.csv`
- [ ] Compare new vs old mappings
- [ ] Document any issues

---

## ⚡ Quick Status Check

**To verify cache is still clear:**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "backend/analytics_service" -Filter "*.db"
# Should return nothing until first upload
```

**To see backup:**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "backend/analytics_service/cache_backup_20251024_202354"
# Should show 6 .db files
```

---

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

The system is now **completely fresh** - no cached mappings, no old data. 

Every column mapping will use the **new improved conversational prompt** that:
- Explains WHAT TANAW does with columns
- Shows HOW columns are used in charts
- Provides decision-making framework
- Gives concrete examples
- Reasons like a business analyst

**Let's see if it works better!** 🎯✨

---

**Status:** ✅ Cache Cleared, Ready for Testing
**Backup Location:** `backend/analytics_service/cache_backup_20251024_202354/`
**Next Step:** Upload an ambiguous test file and observe the results!
