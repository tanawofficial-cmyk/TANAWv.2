# 🚀 TANAW Column Mapping - Optimized Update (v2)

## 📅 Date: October 24, 2025, 8:30 PM

## ✅ What Was Implemented

**Dual Improvement Strategy:**
1. ✅ **Optimized Prompt** - Balanced context with brevity (~500 tokens)
2. ✅ **Smart Fallback Mapper** - Enforces "ONE per type" rule with scoring

---

## 🔄 Changes Made

### **1. Optimized GPT Prompt** (v2)

**Problem with v1 (Long Prompt):**
- ❌ 900 tokens → Too long
- ❌ OpenAI returned broken JSON
- ❌ Fell back to dumb pattern matcher
- ❌ 0% success rate

**New v2 Approach:**
- ✅ ~500 tokens → Balanced length
- ✅ Keeps critical context (chart requirements)
- ✅ Concise decision rules
- ✅ One clear example
- ✅ Enforces "Keep reasoning <100 chars"

**Prompt Structure:**
```
GOAL: Map columns for accurate charts

TANAW CHARTS:
• Product Performance - needs Product + Sales
• Regional Sales - needs Location + Sales
• Sales Trend - needs Date + Sales
(6 key charts listed concisely)

DECISION RULES:
1. DATES - Choose transaction date, ignore system dates
2. SALES - Choose explicit names (Sales > Amount > Value)
3. PRODUCTS - Choose specific (Product_Name > Category)
4. LOCATIONS - Choose primary (Branch > Location2)
5. QUANTITIES - Choose clear (Qty > Count)

CRITICAL: Map ONLY ONE per type!

EXAMPLE: [concise example]

NOW MAP: [columns]
```

**Key Changes:**
- Chart list: 12 detailed → 6 concise ✅
- Rules: Long explanations → Bullet points ✅
- Examples: 3 detailed → 1 concise ✅
- Reasoning limit: None → <100 chars ✅

### **2. Smart Fallback Mapper** (New!)

**Problem with Old Fallback:**
```python
# OLD: Dumb pattern matching
if 'date' in column:
    map_to = "Date"  # ❌ Maps ALL dates (duplicates!)
```

**New Smart Fallback:**
```python
# NEW: Intelligent scoring + prioritization
Step 1: Score all columns for each type
  - Date1 → 90 points (simple name)
  - Date2 → 75 points (secondary)
  - Amount → 85 points (good sales column)
  - Total → 60 points (calculated field)

Step 2: Select BEST for each type
  - Date: Date1 (90 points) ✅
  - Sales: Amount (85 points) ✅

Step 3: Mark others as Ignore
  - Date2 → Ignore ✅
  - Total → Ignore ✅
```

**Scoring Logic:**
```python
DATE columns:
  "Date" or "Date1" = 90 points
  "Order_Date" = 85 points
  "Date2" = 75 points
  "Date_Created" = 50 points (system metadata)

SALES columns:
  "Sales_Amount" = 95 points
  "Sales" = 90 points
  "Amount" = 85 points
  "Revenue" = 80 points
  "Value" = 70 points
  "Total" = 60 points (calculated)

PRODUCT columns:
  "Product_Name" = 95 points
  "Product" = 90 points
  "Item" = 85 points
  "Name" = 75 points
  "Category" = 60 points

LOCATION columns:
  "Branch" = 90 points
  "Location1" = 85 points
  "Location" = 80 points
  "Region" = 80 points
  "Location2" = 50 points (secondary)

QUANTITY columns:
  "Qty" or "Quantity" = 90 points
  "Stock" = 85 points
  "Units" = 80 points
  "Count" = 65 points (might not be quantity!)
```

---

### **3. Better Error Handling**

**Added JSON repair logic:**
```python
try:
    result = json.loads(response_text)
except JSONDecodeError:
    # Try to fix common issues
    cleaned = response_text.replace(',]', ']').replace(',}', '}')
    result = json.loads(cleaned)
    print("✅ Fixed JSON and parsed")
```

**Added debugging output:**
```python
if JSON fails:
    print("⚠️ JSON parse error: {error}")
    print("📄 Raw response (first 500 chars): {response}")
```

---

### **4. System Message Optimization**

**Old (v1 - Too Long):**
```
"You are TANAW Analytics AI - an expert at understanding business datasets and mapping columns intelligently. Your goal is to help business owners generate accurate, meaningful analytics by choosing the RIGHT columns for each chart. You understand business context, can distinguish between transaction vs system data, and know when to mark ambiguous columns as 'Ignore' to prevent misleading charts. You think like a business analyst, not just a data mapper."
```

**New (v2 - Concise):**
```
"You are TANAW Analytics AI - expert at mapping business columns intelligently. Choose ONE column per type, mark duplicates as Ignore. Keep reasoning concise (<100 chars). Return valid JSON only."
```

**Reduction:** 70 words → 30 words

## 📊 Expected Results

### **Test File: `ambiguous_test_challenge.csv`**

**Columns:** [Date1, Date2, Name, Category, Value, Amount, Count, Total, Number, ID, Type, Status, Location1, Location2, Price1, Price2, Qty, Units, Balance, Rate]

**OLD System (v0):**
```
❌ OpenAI never used (too expensive initially)
❌ Fallback maps ALL dates, ALL sales, ALL locations
Result: Duplicates everywhere
```

**v1 System (Long Prompt - FAILED):**
```
❌ OpenAI JSON error (prompt too long)
❌ Fallback maps duplicates
Result: Same as OLD
```

**NEW v2 System (Expected):**
```
Option A - OpenAI succeeds:
  ✅ Date1 → Date (primary)
  ✅ Date2 → Ignore (secondary)
  ✅ Amount → Sales (explicit)
  ✅ Value, Total → Ignore (generic)
  ✅ Name → Product (likely)
  ✅ Category → Ignore (grouping)
  ✅ Location1 → Region (primary)
  ✅ Location2 → Ignore (secondary)
  ✅ Qty → Quantity (primary)
  ✅ Units, Count → Ignore (duplicates)

Option B - OpenAI fails → Smart Fallback:
  ✅ Date1 → Date (score 90, beats Date2 at 75)
  ✅ Date2 → Ignore (duplicate)
  ✅ Amount → Sales (score 85, beats Total at 60)
  ✅ Value, Total → Ignore (duplicates)
  ✅ Location1 → Region (score 85, beats Location2 at 50)
  ✅ Location2 → Ignore (duplicate)
  ✅ Qty → Quantity (score 90, beats Units at 80, Count at 65)
  ✅ Units, Count → Ignore (duplicates)
```

**Either way: NO DUPLICATES! ✅**

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Upload `ambiguous_test_challenge.csv` and check:

### **OpenAI Layer:**
- [ ] Did OpenAI succeed? (no JSON errors)
- [ ] Are duplicates marked as "Ignore"?
- [ ] Is reasoning concise (<100 chars)?
- [ ] Are confidence scores appropriate?

### **Fallback Layer (if OpenAI failed):**
