# Hostinger React Router 404 Fix ✅

## 🎯 Problem

When deploying React app to Hostinger, direct URL access to routes like:
- `/admin` → 404 Error
- `/adminDashboard` → 404 Error
- `/login` → 404 Error
- `/register` → 404 Error

**Why?** Hostinger looks for actual files at those paths, but React Router handles routing client-side.

---

## ✅ Solution: Add .htaccess File

**Created:** `frontend/public/.htaccess`

This file tells Apache server to redirect all requests to `index.html`, allowing React Router to handle routing.

---

## 📝 .htaccess Contents

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Enables URL rewriting
- ✅ Serves actual files if they exist (CSS, JS, images)
- ✅ Redirects all other requests to index.html
- ✅ React Router handles the routing

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Rebuild with .htaccess

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The `.htaccess` file will be copied to `build/` folder automatically.

---

### 2. Upload to Hostinger

Upload **everything** from `frontend/build/` folder:
```
build/
├── index.html
├── .htaccess           ← This is critical!
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   └── js/
├── favicon.png
├── logo192.png
└── logo512.png
```

**Important:** Make sure `.htaccess` is uploaded!

---

### 3. Verify .htaccess is Active

After upload, check:
1. Visit your site: `https://yourdomain.com`
2. Try direct URL: `https://yourdomain.com/admin`
3. Should work! ✅

If still 404:
- Check if `.htaccess` file is in root directory
- Check Hostinger control panel → "Show hidden files" enabled
- Verify Apache `mod_rewrite` is enabled (usually is by default)

---

## 🌐 Alternative: Hostinger File Manager

If `.htaccess` doesn't work, use Hostinger's built-in redirect:

1. **Login to Hostinger Control Panel**
2. **Go to:** Advanced → Redirects
3. **Add Redirect:**
   - Type: Permanent (301)
   - From: `/*`
   - To: `/index.html`

---

## 🎯 What Routes Will Work

After fix, all these will work:

**Public Routes:**
- ✅ `/` → Landing Page
- ✅ `/login` → User Login
- ✅ `/register` → User Registration
- ✅ `/admin` → Admin Login
- ✅ `/features` → Features Page
- ✅ `/docs` → Documentation
- ✅ `/support` → Support Page
- ✅ `/contact` → Contact Page
- ✅ `/about` → About Page

**Protected Routes:**
- ✅ `/userDashboard` → User Dashboard
- ✅ `/adminDashboard` → Admin Dashboard

---

## 🔧 Backend Configuration

Don't forget to configure backend URL in production!

**In `frontend/src/api.js`:**
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || "http://localhost:5000/api";
```

**Set environment variable before build:**
```bash
# Windows
set REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.hostinger.com/api

# Or create .env.production file
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.hostinger.com/api
```

## 📋 Complete Deployment Checklist

### Frontend:
- [x] Build created: `npm run build`
- [x] `.htaccess` file created
- [ ] Upload `build/` folder to Hostinger
- [ ] Verify `.htaccess` uploaded
- [ ] Test direct URL access to `/admin`

### Backend:
- [ ] Deploy Node.js backend to Hostinger
- [ ] Deploy Flask analytics service
- [ ] Configure MongoDB connection
- [ ] Set environment variables
- [ ] Update CORS settings for production domain

---

## 🎉 After Fix

**Before:**
```
https://yourdomain.com/admin → 404 Not Found ❌
```

**After:**
```
https://yourdomain.com/admin → Admin Login Page ✅
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### .htaccess File Location:
- ✅ Must be in `public/` folder (so it gets copied to build/)
- ✅ Will automatically be in `build/` after npm run build
- ✅ Must be uploaded to Hostinger web root

### File Visibility:
- Files starting with `.` are hidden by default
- Enable "Show hidden files" in Hostinger File Manager
- Or use FTP client that shows hidden files

### Server Requirements:
- ✅ Apache server (Hostinger uses Apache)
- ✅ mod_rewrite enabled (usually enabled by default)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Rebuild frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload to Hostinger:**
   - Upload entire `build/` folder
   - Verify `.htaccess` is there

3. **Test:**
   - Visit `/admin` directly
   - Should work! ✅

**Rebuild now and re-upload - the .htaccess file will fix your 404 errors! 🎉**
