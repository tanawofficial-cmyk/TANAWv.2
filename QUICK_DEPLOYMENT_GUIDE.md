---

## ‚úÖ **Deployment Complete!**

### **Your Live URLs:**
```
Frontend:  https://[your-site].netlify.app
Backend:   https://tanaw-backend.onrender.com
Analytics: https://tanaw-analytics.onrender.com
Database:  MongoDB Atlas (cloud)
```

### **Test the System:**
1. Visit frontend URL
2. Register an account
3. Login
4. Upload a test CSV

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **Free Tier Limitations:**
- ‚è∞ **Auto-sleep:** Services sleep after 15 min inactivity
- ‚è∞ **Wake time:** ~30 seconds for first request
- üíæ **Storage:** Ephemeral (uploaded files deleted on restart)
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Compute:** 750 hours/month limit

**For Defense:** Acceptable! Just wake services before demo.

### **Production Considerations:**
- üí∞ Upgrade to paid tier ($7-19/month per service)
- üíæ Use AWS S3 for persistent file storage
- üìß Configure email service properly
- üîê Add rate limiting
- üìä Set up monitoring (optional)

---

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Backend won't start:**
```
Check:
1. MONGO_URI is correct
2. All dependencies in package.json
3. Port 5000 not hardcoded
4. Look at Render logs
```

### **Analytics service won't start:**
```
Check:
1. OPENAI_API_KEY is set
2. requirements.txt has all packages
3. Python version is 3.12
4. Look at Render logs
```

### **Frontend can't connect to backend:**
```
Check:
1. REACT_APP_API_URL is correct
2. Backend CORS allows frontend domain
3. Backend is running (visit /api/health)
4. Rebuild frontend after env change
```

### **Charts not generating:**
```
Check:
1. Analytics service is running
2. ANALYTICS_SERVICE_URL in backend is correct
3. OPENAI_API_KEY is valid
4. Check analytics service logs
```

## üéØ **For Your Capstone Defense**

### **Before Defense Day:**
1. ‚úÖ Deploy all services (30 minutes)
2. ‚úÖ Test thoroughly (upload datasets, check charts)
3. ‚úÖ Note all URLs
4. ‚úÖ Wake services 5 minutes before defense (visit URLs)
5. ‚úÖ Prepare demo datasets
6. ‚úÖ Have backup local version running

### **During Defense:**
- Show **live deployed version** (impressive! üéâ)
- Have **local version** as backup (in case internet issues)
- **URLs to share** with panel (let them test!)

### **Benefits of Deployed Version:**
- ‚úÖ Proves production-readiness
- ‚úÖ Panel can test on their devices
- ‚úÖ Professional presentation
- ‚úÖ Shows real cloud deployment
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates technical competence

## üíº **Alternative: One-Server Deployment**

**If panel asks about other options:**

"We could also deploy everything on a **single DigitalOcean droplet** for $6/month:
- Nginx serves the React frontend
- PM2 runs the Node.js backend
- Gunicorn runs the Python analytics
- All on one server with full control

This is more cost-effective for very small businesses, but we prefer the **microservices approach** because:
1. Each service can scale independently
2. Easier to maintain and debug
3. Better fault isolation
4. Industry best practice
5. Cloud-native architecture"
