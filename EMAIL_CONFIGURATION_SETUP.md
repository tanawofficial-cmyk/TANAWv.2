# 📧 Email Configuration Setup for Password Reset

## 🔍 **Current Status**

✅ **Password reset functionality is WORKING** but in **TESTING MODE**

**What this means**:
- ✅ Password reset tokens are generated correctly
- ✅ Reset links work and expire after 1 hour
- ✅ Password changes are saved to database
- ⚠️ **Emails are sent to Ethereal (fake SMTP)** instead of real Gmail
- ⚠️ Users won't receive actual emails in their inbox

---

## 🎯 **How It Currently Works**

### **Testing Mode (Ethereal Email)**:
```
User requests password reset
     ↓
Token generated and saved to database ✅
     ↓
Email sent to: smtp.ethereal.email (FAKE SMTP) ⚠️
     ↓
Terminal shows: "Preview URL: https://ethereal.email/message/..."
     ↓
User doesn't receive email in real inbox ❌
```

**Terminal Output**:
```
⚠️ No email service configured. Using Ethereal for testing.
📧 Using Ethereal test email account: test@ethereal.email
📧 Preview URL: https://ethereal.email/message/abc123
✅ Password reset email sent to: user@example.com
```

---

## ✅ **Solution: Configure Gmail**

To send **real emails** to users, add these environment variables to `backend/.env`:

### **Step 1: Add Email Configuration**

Open `backend/.env` and add:

```env
# Email Configuration (for Password Reset)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=tanawofficial@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password_here
EMAIL_FROM=tanawofficial@gmail.com
```

---

### **Step 2: Create Gmail App Password**

**Why App Password?**
- Gmail requires App Passwords for third-party apps
- Regular password won't work

**How to create**:
1. Go to Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Navigate to **Security** → **2-Step Verification** (enable if not already)
3. Scroll to **App Passwords**
4. Click **Generate new app password**
5. Select **Mail** and **Other (Custom name)**
6. Name it: **"TANAW Password Reset"**
7. Click **Generate**
8. Copy the 16-character password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

**Update .env**:
```env
EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
```

---

### **Step 3: Restart Backend Server**

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Or if using nodemon:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing After Configuration**

### **Test Password Reset**:

1. **Go to Login page**
2. **Click "Forgot Password?"**
3. **Enter email**: `test@example.com` (any registered email)
4. **Check Terminal** for:
   ```
   ✅ Password reset email sent to: test@example.com
   ```
5. **Check Gmail inbox** (tanawofficial@gmail.com won't receive it, user will)
6. **User receives email** with reset link ✅

---

## 📧 **Email Flow After Configuration**

```
User requests password reset
     ↓
Token generated ✅
     ↓
Email sent via Gmail SMTP to: user@example.com
From: tanawofficial@gmail.com ✅
     ↓
User receives email in their inbox ✅
     ↓
User clicks reset link
     ↓
Password successfully changed ✅
     ↓
Confirmation email sent ✅
```

## 🔧 **Alternative: Keep Testing Mode**

If you want to keep testing mode for development:

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No Gmail configuration needed
- ✅ No App Password required
- ✅ View emails at https://ethereal.email
- ✅ Functionality still works (just emails go to fake SMTP)

**How to use**:
1. Don't add EMAIL_SERVICE to .env
2. When password reset is triggered, check terminal for:
   ```
   📧 Preview URL: https://ethereal.email/message/abc123
   ```
3. Click the URL to view the email in browser
4. Copy the reset link from the preview

**This is fine for development but NOT for production!**

---

## ⚙️ **Current Configuration**

**In `backend/services/emailService.js`**:

```javascript
if (process.env.EMAIL_SERVICE === "gmail") {
  // Use Gmail ✅
  return nodemailer.createTransporter({
    service: "gmail",
    auth: {
      user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,        // tanawofficial@gmail.com
      pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD,    // App Password
    },
  });
} else {
  // Testing mode (Ethereal) ⚠️
  console.warn("⚠️ No email service configured. Using Ethereal for testing.");
  // Creates fake SMTP account
}
```

---

## 📋 **Required Environment Variables**

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `EMAIL_SERVICE` | `gmail` | Use Gmail SMTP |
| `EMAIL_USER` | `tanawofficial@gmail.com` | Gmail account |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | `(16-char app password)` | Gmail App Password |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | `tanawofficial@gmail.com` | From address |

---

## ✅ **What's Already Working**

Even in testing mode:
- ✅ Password reset tokens generate correctly
- ✅ Tokens expire after 1 hour
- ✅ Reset links work properly
- ✅ Password changes save to database
- ✅ Confirmation emails are sent
- ✅ Security is implemented correctly

**Only missing**: Real email delivery to users' inboxes

---

## 🚀 **Recommendation**

**For Development**: Keep testing mode (current setup) ✅
**For Production**: Configure Gmail with App Password

**To enable real emails, just add 4 lines to `backend/.env`**:
```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=tanawofficial@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here
EMAIL_FROM=tanawofficial@gmail.com
```

Then restart the backend server!
