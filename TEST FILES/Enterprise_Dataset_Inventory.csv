They are collections of Single Member Districts (SMDs). ANCs allow input from an advisory board made up of the residents of the neighborhoods directly affected by government action. The ANCs are the body of government with the closest official ties to the people in a neighborhood. ANCs present their positions and recommendations on issues to various District government agencies, the Executive Branch, and the Council. They also present testimony to independent agencies, boards and commissions, usually under rules of procedure specific to those entities. By law, the ANCs may also present their positions to Federal agencies. ANCs consider a wide range of policies and programs affecting their neighborhoods. These include traffic, parking, recreation, street improvements, liquor licenses, zoning, economic development, police protection, sanitation and trash collection, and the District's annual budget. No public policy area is excluded from the purview of the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions.

Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). The project was funded by the United States Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) directed NTIA to develop and maintain a comprehensive nationwide inventory map of broadband service capability and availability, and to make the map publicly available via the Internet. NTIA is collecting data from all 50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia. Detailed information about this project can be found in the State Broadband Data and Development Grant Program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) (http://www.ntia.doc.gov/frnotices/2009/FR_BroadbandMappingNOFA_090708.pdf) and subsequent clarifications. This data collection is to be conducted on a semi-annual basis over a five-year period. This data will attempts to reflect conditions in the field as of December 2009. The data is covered by nondisclosure agreements entered into by OCTO and broadband providers. The data contains COMMERCIAL / PROPRIETARY and CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The data is compiled solely for use by NTIA and cooperating federal agencies. Redistribution of the data in its raw form is prohibited. NTIA will use the data collected by grantees including the District of Columbia, in combination with other data sources, to create and publish online the National Broadband Map by February 17, 2011. The map will further educate consumers and businesses about broadband Internet availability, enable broadband Internet providers and investors to make better-informed decisions regarding the use of their private capital for future broadband investment, and inform the decisions of Federal, State, and local policymakers as they work to expand the benefits of broadband to all Americans.","broadband, communication",Utility and Communication,Database,No,No,2018,Level 0 Open,,,,No,No,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/21213913e1ea415194a8b56321046b8e,Yearly,1900/01/01 05:00:00+00,Frequent Requests,Retired,"No longer maintainted.

The Metropolitan Police Department collects race and ethnicity data according to the United States Census Bureau standards (https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html). Hispanic, which was previously categorized under the Race field prior to August 2015, is now captured under Ethnicity. All records prior to August 2015 have been updated to “Unknown (Race), Hispanic (Ethnicity)”. Race, ethnicity and gender data are based on officer observation, which may or may not be accurate.

Due to privacy considerations, exact CCNs and arrest numbers for these arrest datasets are not provided. In lieu, hash numbers are provided for CNN which allows individuals to determine whether there are multiple arrests associated with one event. Additionally, arrest numbers can be linked directly to an individual and therefore DC government does not provide this more generally, but again as hash numbers.

MPD cannot release exact addresses to the general public unless proof of ownership or subpoena is submitted. The GeoX and GeoY values represent the block location (approximately 232 ft. radius) as of the date of the arrest and offense. Arrest and offense addresses that could not be geocoded are included as an “unknown” value.

Arrestee age is calculated based on the number of days between the self-reported or verified date of birth (DOB) of the arrestee and the date of the arrest; DOB data may not be accurate if self-reported, and an arrestee may refuse to provide his or her date of birth. Due to the sensitive nature of juvenile data and to protect the arrestee’s confidentiality, any arrest records for defendants under the age of 18 or with missing age are excluded in this dataset.

The Criminal Complaint Number (CCN) and arrest number have also been anonymized.

This data may not match other arrest data requests that may have included all law enforcement agencies in the District or all arrest charges.

The number of anticipated housing development units expected to be filled per year based on size and type of building between 2024 and 2033 were compiled in March 2022 from the DC Office of Planning and Washington DC Economic Partnership.

Senior housing turnover										
Housing units identified in the Integrated Tax System Public Extract as receiving senior exemptions formed the base population of this element of the analysis. There is a specific rule in the District that allows homeowners to take a 50% cat on their tax bill if 1) at least one owner of the property is 65 or older, 2) total household adjusted gross income (not wealth) is less than $125K, and 3) the senior has at least 50% ownership of the property to qualify. A historic annual rate of sale was applied to this number to arrive at an estimate for the number of senior housing that could become available between 2024 and 2028.

Mosquitoes have the potential to spread harmful diseases. During the annual mosquito season in Washington DC, usually from April – October, DC Healthdeploys surveillance and mitigation methods to control the mosquito population in the District. DC Health (also known as the D.C. Department of Health or formerly DOH) has been trapping and testing mosquitoes for West Nile virus (WNV) for well over a decade. Starting in 2016, and in response to the Zika outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean, DC Health substantially increased mosquito monitoring activities across the city. There were a total of 28 sites and 36 traps across the 8 wards. Data was submitted to the Centers for Disease Control MoquitoNet Portal.

Note: the 2017 analysis does not include data for October. This is because October of 2017 would have skewed the results far too much based on a few variables that occurred. For example, the number of traps which had failed by the end of the season.

Mosquito species in Washington, D.C.:

Culex Pipiens, Salinarius and Culex Restuan: spread West Nile Virus

Aedes aegypti : according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), health experts have determined this species to be the most competent vector, capable of transmitting Zika to the human population. To date, none of the Aedes aegypti trapped in Washington, D.C. have been found to carry the Zika virus.

Aedes albopictus: capable of spreading Zika to people. However, health experts are still learning whether it is likely to do so as it appears at this time, it is not as competent a vector for transmitting Zika as is the Aedes aegypti. Just because a mosquito can carry the virus does not mean that it will cause disease. So far, none of the Aedes albopictus trapped in Washington, D.C. have been found to carry the Zika virus.
